# My notes


This is a set of notes I will be writing while reading about the language.



## What is Groovy?

For what I understand, Groovy is a language programming that uses the JVM to exist, i.e. it has syntax very Java-alike, therefore code is executed there. But it has also other perks, such as:  
* It's way lighter than Java.  
* The goal while creating it was making it very alike to Java so the learning curve wouldn't be so hard.  
* It can ve viewed as a Java complement, although it can do stuff on it's own.
